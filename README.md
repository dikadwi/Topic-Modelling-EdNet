## üîç Overview

This project explores how **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** can be used to model question topics and generate **semantic learning profiles** for students using large-scale data from the **EdNet-KT1** dataset. Students‚Äô interactions with tagged questions are transformed into pseudotexts, clustered by dominant topic, and used to calculate **topic-wise accuracy**. These representations form the basis for **student segmentation** and **adaptive learning recommendations**.

## üß™ Key Features

- Semantic topic extraction with **LDA** (via Gensim)
- Coherence evaluation (c_v metric: **0.6688** with 20 topics)
- Topic-wise student accuracy matrix (user √ó topic)
- Visual analytics: **heatmap**, **radar chart**, **line plot**, **PCA**
- Clustering of students using **K-Means**
- Topic recommendations based on accuracy thresholds
